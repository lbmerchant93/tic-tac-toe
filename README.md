## Overview
This is the final project for the 2010 Front End Cohort, which is used to show an understanding of the concepts discussed in Module 1. The objective of the project was to create an application that allows two users to play the age old game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Students must use their knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to display a functioning game and design that shows which player's and the number of wins each player has. The number of wins should persist across a page reload.
